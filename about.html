            <h1>APPLE INC.</h1>
            <p>
                Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, in
                Silicon Valley, best known for its consumer electronics, software and online services. Founded in 1976
                as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by
                Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed to its current name in 2007
                as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is considered part
                of the Big Tech group, alongside Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta.

                The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its successor, the
                Apple II, became one of the first successful mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in
                1983 and the Macintosh in 1984 as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a
                mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT and Wozniak withdrawing to
                other ventures; John Sculley served as CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable
                market share in the personal computer industry to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of Intel-powered PC
                clones running Microsoft Windows. In 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed
                operating system strategy, it bought NeXT, effectively bringing Jobs back to the company, who guided
                Apple back to profitability by introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices; creating the iTunes
                Store; launching the "Think different" advertising campaign; and opening the Apple Store retail chain.
                These moves elevated Apple to consistently be one of the world's most valuable brands since about 2010.
                Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later; he was succeeded as CEO by Tim
                Cook.

                Apple's product lineup includes portable and home hardware such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac,
                and Apple TV; operating systems such as iOS, iPadOS, and macOS; and various software and services
                including Apple Pay, iCloud, and multimedia streaming services like Apple Music and Apple TV+. Since
                2011, Apple has for the most part been the world's largest company by market capitalization, and, as of
                2023, is the largest manufacturing company by revenue, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by
                unit sales, the largest vendor of tablet computers, and the largest vendor of mobile phones. Apple
                became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in 2018, and, as of
                September 2025, is valued at just over $3.47 trillion.

                Apple has received criticism regarding its contractors' labor practices, its relationship with trade
                unions, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and
                materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand
                loyalty.
