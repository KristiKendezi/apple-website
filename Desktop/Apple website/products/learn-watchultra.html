       <h2>Hit the ground running with the Action button</h2>
       <p>It’s customizable and gives you quick control over a variety of functions, so you can do things like control a workout, move to your next interval, mark a segment, and more. All with extreme precision.</p>

       <h2>All you need is your watch</h2>
       <p>Take and make calls, download music and podcasts, and pay for your post-run latte on the go.8 And thanks to a new 5G modem and antenna architecture, Ultra 3 provides better coverage in areas with weak reception.</p>

        <h2>Advance with advanced metrics</h2>
        <p>Track your progress with metrics like running power and cadence. And if you create a Custom Workout on your watch or iPhone, you can add work and recovery intervals, set a pace for outdoor workouts, and more. You can even get an estimate of your VO2 max after your run.</p>
       
        <h2>Track your training load</h2>
        <p>Helpful insights from training load show the impact your workouts have on your body over time, so it’s easier to plan when to push and when to rest — especially useful when you’re training for your next big event.</p>
       
        <h2>Monitor your Heart Rate Zones</h2>
        <p>Quickly see your exercise intensity level with Heart Rate Zones, which are automatically calculated and personalized using your health data. You can adjust them manually or set up alerts.</p>

        <h2>Run with Race Route and Pacer.</h2>
        <p> Race Route allows you to race against your last or best time on your favorite runs. Pacer lets you pick a distance and time target for an outdoor run and tells you when you’re on or off track.</p>
