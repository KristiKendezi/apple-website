       <h2>Know your body by heart</h2>
       <p>The more insights you have, the more empowered you are to take action. From the ECG app to the Vitals app and more, Apple Watch Series 11 provides a bigger picture of your health, so you can stay informed. And now Series 11 takes the next big step in heart health with a pioneering feature — hypertension notifications.</p>

       <h2>Wake up to your sleep score</h2>
       <p>Sleep quality is influenced by factors such as sleep duration, bedtime consistency, how often you wake up, and time spent in each sleep stage. Sleep score analyzes these factors every night and provides a classification and a score. You’ll see how the score is calculated, so you can understand the quality of your sleep and learn how to make it more restorative.

        <h2>Keep an eye on sleep apnea</h2>
        <p>Sleep apnea is a condition where people experience repeated interruptions in their regular respiratory pattern during sleep. If untreated, it can lead to increased risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiac issues, and more. Series 11 can monitor for breathing disturbances over time and notify you of possible sleep apnea.</p>

        <h2>Better by every measure</h2>
        <p>Whether you’re training for a marathon or swimming laps, Apple Watch Series 11 serves up endless ways to work out. And it uses helpful metrics to count every move, so you know how to push harder and train smarter. Let’s go — the starting line is on your wrist.</p>
